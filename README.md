# PySimpleGUI-Legacy

This repository provides a functional, pre-license version of the **PySimpleGUI** library for developers who need a free and unrestricted solution. The official PySimpleGUI library has recently transitioned to a paid license model, leaving many developers unable to access or use the library. This backup allows you to continue using the legacy version without any license requirements.

## What is PySimpleGUI?

**PySimpleGUI** is a Python library that simplifies the process of creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It abstracts away the complexity of underlying frameworks like Tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi, offering a beginner-friendly, high-level API. With PySimpleGUI, you can build interactive desktop applications, file explorers, progress trackers, and more with minimal code.

### Key Features of PySimpleGUI:
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Intuitive syntax, ideal for developers new to GUIs.
- **Rich Component Library**: Buttons, text inputs, sliders, progress bars, tables, and more.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Allows real-time updates to GUI elements during execution.
- **Integration Ready**: Supports Matplotlib, OpenCV, and other libraries for advanced functionality.

## Why Use an Older Version of PySimpleGUI?

On [today's date], the creator of PySimpleGUI announced a transition to a paid license model. As part of this change:
1. **A license key is now required** to use any version installed via `pip`.
2. **Older, free versions of PySimpleGUI have been removed** from the PyPI repository, preventing developers from simply downgrading to a previous version.
3. Developers who rely on PySimpleGUI for personal projects, open-source software, or educational purposes are now locked out unless they pay for a license.

This repository offers a solution by providing a backup of the last free and functional version of PySimpleGUI.

## Why Can't You Use `pip` to Downgrade PySimpleGUI?

Normally, developers can install a specific version of a library using `pip install PySimpleGUI==<version>`. However, with the recent change:
1. **The author has removed older versions** from the PyPI repository, making downgrading impossible.
2. This forces developers to use the latest version, which now requires a paid license.

As a result, the only way to access a fully functional version is through a saved copy, such as the one provided in this repository.
